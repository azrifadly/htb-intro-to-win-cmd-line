- Using powershell, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse *.txt | Where-Object {$_.Length -gt 0}`
  
  <br>I am using the powershell version of dir for `Get-ChildItem`
  <br>`-Recurse` to search through all sub directories
  <br>`flag.txt` = because i know that the flag has this naming convention
  <br>now I pipe `|` the output to pass it to another command
  <br>`where-object` works like a filter
  <br>`$_` represents for each file
  <br>`.length` is the property for getting the size of a file in bytes
  <br>`-gt 0` is just greater than zero
  
- `cd C:\Users\user4\Documents\3\4` Change to the given directory where the flag.txt resides
- `cat flag.txt` show contents of the flag.txt
